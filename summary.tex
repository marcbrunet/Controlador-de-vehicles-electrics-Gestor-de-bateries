The project consists on the implementation of an electrical vehicle controller. This project has been done jointly with Marc Brunet Preses. The project is divided and document in two parts separately, one is for the battery management system and the other is for the motor driver. This project in particular, explains the functioning of the electric bateries, the battery management system at a theoretical level and finally explains the theoretical implementation of a battery management system prototype. In this project it is explained the different typess of batteries, charge methods, cells ballancing, temperature control, operation of the chip prototype, among many other things. What it has been wanted to achieve in this project is the acquisition of all the knowledge that surrounds the world of batteries.
